# BBC_Research

The purpose of this research project was to improve upon the Byte-aligned Bitmap Code (BBC) compression algorithm.
This new variation of the BBC algorithm is called the Byte-algined Bitmap Exponetial Compression (BBEC) algorithm.  

## How BBC works

BBC is a fill-based compression algorithm that is capable of storing both 0 and 1 fills.  
The algorithm compresses raw data into portions called runs, there are four kinds of runs in BBC.
